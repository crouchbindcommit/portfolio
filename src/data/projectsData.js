    title: 'Voice Recognize',
    shortDescription: 'A 44.79% Accurate Voice Recognition model in MATLab.',
    longDescription: `
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Speech Recognition Project</strong> aims to analyze the pitch contours and cepstrum features of speech recordings to identify unique characteristics in a speaker's voice. This project involves recording multiple speech samples, analyzing their pitch contours, and evaluating the ability to distinguish between different speakers using machine learning techniques.</p>

<p>The project investigates how the pitch contour of a voice can be used to identify speakers, especially in an environment with multiple similar recordings. The challenge lies in the nuances of human speech, such as rhythm, cadence, syllable stress, and intonation, which can make it difficult for a system to differentiate between speakers, especially when the recordings have similarities.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pitch Contour Analysis:</strong> The project analyzed the pitch contours of voice recordings to identify similarities and differences between speakers. It was expected that native English speakers would show similar pitch contours in their speech.</li>
<li><strong>Euclidean Distance Metric:</strong> Used to measure the similarity between the pitch contours of different speakers, which helped in determining the accuracy of speaker differentiation.</li>
<li><strong>Cepstrum Analysis:</strong> Investigated how cepstral analysis, which focuses on the spectral features of voice, could be used alongside pitch contour analysis to improve recognition accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Speaker Comparison:</strong> The system compared the pitch contour of various speakers, including a baseline comparison to assess how similar or different the voices were.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Used Euclidean distance and other algorithms to compare pitch contours and differentiate between speakers.</li>
<li><strong>Speech Analysis:</strong> Pitch and cepstrum analysis were used to process the voice recordings and extract relevant features for recognition.</li>
<li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> A variety of speech features were considered, including cadence, rhythm, and syllable stress, to understand how they impact speaker differentiation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cybersecurity Practices:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Efforts were made to ensure the quality and consistency of the recorded voice samples by minimizing variables and ensuring uniformity across recordings.</li>
<li><strong>Model Validation:</strong> The accuracy of the machine learning model was evaluated, and improvements were suggested, such as including additional checks to differentiate between male and female voices.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges and Insights:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pitch Contour Similarities:</strong> The system had difficulty differentiating between speakers with similar pitch contours, such as in the case of male speakers who exhibit similar cadence and rhythm patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional and Environmental Factors:</strong> Pitch can be influenced by emotional states or environmental noise, making speaker identification harder. Cepstrum analysis was proposed to handle these physical voice characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Improving Accuracy:</strong> While initial accuracy was low (44%), future work could focus on incorporating additional checks for gender differentiation or other unique speech features to improve performance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion and Future Work:</h3>
<p>The <strong>Speech Recognition Project</strong> highlighted the complexities of speaker identification through pitch and cepstrum analysis. By combining both methods, we could improve recognition by focusing on the emotional patterns of speech (pitch) while also considering the physical aspects (cepstrum). Although challenges remain, particularly in distinguishing between speakers with similar characteristics, this project demonstrates the potential for further advancements in speech recognition systems.</p>

<p>In future iterations, more robust models incorporating multiple features could be developed to further improve the accuracy and robustness of speaker recognition systems, particularly in varied environments.</p>

    longDescription: `
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>Automated Hydroponic Tank</strong> is a fully integrated hydroponic system designed to automate key processes such as nutrient solution distribution, water aeration, and lighting control. The project was developed by a team of four students, with each member contributing unique expertise. I contributed the project idea, scope, and the research behind the development, helping to structure the VHDL code along with my team members.</p>

<p>The goal of the project was to create a modular, indoor hydroponic system capable of sustaining plants without soil by circulating water with nutrients and providing artificial lighting. The system is designed to be reliable and easy to use, offering full automation for the care of plants.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Water-Tight Tank:</strong> A custom-built acrylic tank that holds the water and houses the plant, ensuring the system is watertight to protect electronics from water damage.</li>
<li><strong>Water Pump:</strong> A pump circulates water within the system, ensuring that the water is properly aerated and that the nutrients are distributed evenly.</li>
<li><strong>Solenoid Nutrient Release:</strong> A solenoid valve controls the release of nutrients into the water, ensuring that the plants receive the proper nourishment for growth.</li>
<li><strong>Day/Night Cycle:</strong> The system features a day/night cycle for lighting control, simulating natural conditions to enhance plant growth.</li>
<li><strong>Water Aeration:</strong> Ensures that the water remains clean, free of algae, and oxygenated for healthy plant roots.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>VHDL Programming:</strong> The system's behavior is controlled by a VHDL program running on the <strong>Basys 3 Board</strong>, with timing logic that drives the systemâ€™s operations such as nutrient distribution and water aeration.</li>
<li><strong>Logic Level Shifting:</strong> The project used MOSFETs (BSS138) to shift logic levels from the 3.3V output of the Basys board to the 5V required by the relays controlling the pump and solenoid.</li>
<li><strong>Relay Logic:</strong> The pump, lights, and solenoid were controlled through relays, which were driven by the VHDL program.</li>
<li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> The system is powered by a 120VAC to 12VDC laptop charger, with additional voltage regulation using a buck converter to step down to 5V for the Basys 3 board and other components.</li>
<li><strong>Timer Logic:</strong> The timer was implemented by counting clock cycles on the 100 MHz internal clock of the Basys 3, allowing the system to track time for operations such as lighting cycles and nutrient dispensing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>System Operation:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day/Night Cycle:</strong> The VHDL program uses a timer to simulate a day/night cycle, turning the grow lights on and off at appropriate times to mimic natural light conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Nutrient Distribution:</strong> The solenoid valve is triggered based on the timing logic to release nutrients into the water at specific intervals, ensuring the plant receives the necessary nutrients for optimal growth.</li>
<li><strong>Water Aeration:</strong> The pump continuously circulates water to keep it oxygenated and prevent stagnation, ensuring a healthy growing environment for the plant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges and Solutions:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logic Level Shifting:</strong> The Basys 3 board operates at 3.3V, but the relays used to control the pump and solenoid require 5V logic. This challenge was resolved by using BSS138 MOSFETs for logic level shifting.</li>
<li><strong>Power Supply Management:</strong> Different components required different voltages. A 12VDC laptop charger was used to power the system, with a buck converter stepping down the voltage to 5V for the Basys 3 and other components.</li>
<li><strong>Timer Implementation:</strong> The Basys 3 board does not have a built-in timer module, so we created a custom timer using clock cycles to track time for the day/night cycle and other timed operations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>The <strong>Automated Hydroponic Tank</strong> project successfully demonstrates the application of embedded systems and VHDL programming for controlling an indoor hydroponic environment. By automating critical operations such as nutrient delivery, water aeration, and lighting control, this system provides a reliable and efficient solution for plant growth without the need for soil.</p>

<p>While we encountered some challenges with logic level shifting and power management, the system was ultimately successful in creating a fully functional hydroponic tank that can be used for growing plants in a controlled, automated environment. This project highlights the intersection of hardware design, software programming, and environmental control in a practical, real-world application.</p>

    title: 'Email Sender',
    shortDescription: 'Fundraising Tool for Local Womens Rugby Team',
    longDescription: `
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Automated Donor Outreach Tool for Womenâ€™s Rugby</strong> is a Python-based utility designed to assist my local senior side womenâ€™s rugby team in streamlining the process of identifying and contacting potential donors. The tool automates web searching for emails, allows for human verification, and supports templated email sending with attachments. Its design prioritizes both functionality and accessibility for non-technical users on the teamâ€™s board.</p>

<p>The project was created with practical fundraising in mind, specifically targeting silent auction donations. It accommodates differences between new and returning sponsors and ensures manual oversight in cases where web automation may yield inaccurate results.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Searching with Google API:</strong> The tool queries the web using business names listed in an Excel spreadsheet. Each found email is saved immediately upon discovery, mitigating data loss if the API limit is reached mid-process. This approach prioritizes data retention over runtime efficiency.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Manual Verification Workflow:</strong> The system intentionally separates the web search and email sending stages to allow for human verification. This prevents misdirected outreach â€” for example, when a search finds a journalistâ€™s email instead of the intended business contact.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Email Sending Logic:</strong> Emails are sent in markdown format with support for file attachments. The system distinguishes between new and returning donors, sending personalized messages with appropriate content and tone for each case.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Structure:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attachments Directory:</strong> Supports any file type. For this campaign, it included a PNG image showcasing last yearâ€™s sponsors and a PDF version of the current sponsorship package.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Email Templates:</strong> The tool supports customized messaging. Returning donors receive messages thanking them and explaining the impact of their past support, while new donors receive an introduction to the team and the silent auction fundraising goal.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Excel Integration:</strong> The <code>DATA.xlsx</code> file (renameable) serves as the projectâ€™s data source. <code>scrape.py</code> reads the business names, performs the web search, and writes both the email and source URL back into the spreadsheet for easy review.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Email Dispatch:</strong> <code>sender.py</code> reads the updated spreadsheet and sends the appropriate email (new or returning) to each contact. When available, the system addresses recipients by name; otherwise, it defaults to the business name.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Accessible Configuration (<code>settings.py</code>):</strong> Designed for ease-of-use by non-technical users. Email credentials, API keys, sender display name, subject line, and the Excel filename are all stored here. While this method sacrifices best security practices, it prioritizes usability for the intended audience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Python:</strong> Core logic and automation for querying, processing, and emailing.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Search API:</strong> Used for web scraping email addresses based on business names.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenPyXL:</strong> For reading from and writing to Excel files.</li>
  <li><strong>smtplib and email.mime:</strong> To construct and send emails with support for markdown and attachments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p><strong>The Automated Donor Outreach Tool</strong> supports grassroots fundraising through thoughtful, accessible automation. By combining custom email generation, real-time web search, and clear opportunities for human verification, the project helps ensure effective and accurate donor communication.</p>

<p>While built for a specific local rugby initiative, the structure and design of this tool are flexible enough to be adapted for other community fundraising efforts, making it a valuable model for accessible, semi-automated outreach.</p>

    title: 'Credit Check',
    shortDescription: 'Innovative Credit Score for the Deutsche Bank',
    longDescription: `
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Alternative Credit Scoring Model</strong> was developed during the inaugural Deutsche Bank Early Career Hackathon. I was placed on a team with three other students and challenged to create an innovative approach to rethinking how credit scores are calculated. We had just 7 hours to brainstorm, prototype, and present our solution.</p>

<p>The project initially began using VueJS and NodeJS for frontend and backend development, respectively. However, due to unexpected hosting constraints, we transitioned the frontend to AngularJS to meet the final submission requirements within the time limit.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Student-Focused Credit Evaluation:</strong> Our model was designed with students in mindâ€”an often overlooked demographic in traditional credit scoring systems.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Expanded Scoring Metrics:</strong> Rather than relying solely on financial history, we considered a range of academic and socioeconomic factors:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GPA:</strong> Higher GPA scores positively influence credit evaluation, signaling responsibility and performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Graduation Year:</strong> Students closer to graduation are considered more likely to gain stable employment soon.</li>
      <li><strong>College Major:</strong> Certain disciplines with higher employment rates receive favorable scoring.</li>
      <li><strong>Work History:</strong> Prior part-time jobs, internships, or co-op experiences improve scores by showing early financial engagement.</li>
      <li><strong>Parental Income:</strong> A proxy for potential financial backing, parental income was factored in to account for support systems that could influence repayment likelihood.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Innovative Thinking:</h3>
<p>The project pushed boundaries by incorporating behavioral and contextual data into credit evaluation. A traditional model might assign equal scores to two users who take out a $1,000 loan, regardless of personal financial behavior. However, we discussed future enhancements that consider <strong>psychological prioritization of repayment</strong>. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A user earning $50,000 annually who delays repayment may indicate low financial responsibility, resulting in a lower score.</li>
  <li>Conversely, a user earning $2,000 who prioritizes repayment demonstrates a high degree of responsibility and should receive a higher score.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>AngularJS:</strong> Used for the final user interface after pivoting from VueJS due to deployment limitations.</li>
  <li><strong>NodeJS:</strong> Powered the backend API to process user input and simulate score calculation logic.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript & REST:</strong> Enabled real-time interaction between frontend inputs and backend logic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p><strong>The Alternative Credit Scoring Model</strong> reimagines financial evaluation through the lens of potential, behavior, and backgroundâ€”not just past transactions. By targeting student users and emphasizing holistic metrics, the project opens up credit opportunity to a group often underrepresented by traditional scoring systems.</p>

<p>Future development could deepen the behavioral aspect of credit evaluation, using machine learning or behavioral economics to build profiles that more accurately reflect financial reliability beyond raw income or debt history.</p>
