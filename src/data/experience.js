  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <h3>PQI Webtool Development</h3>
  <p>
    I worked on the development of the <strong>PQI Webtool</strong>, a proprietary tool for the <strong>Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)</strong>, where I specifically developed the <strong>navigator</strong> and <strong>tools pages</strong> to display data in a more modern and user-friendly structure.
  </p>

  <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
  <p>
    On the frontend, I restructured the <strong>navigator</strong> to simplify the drill-down process. Previously, users were required to select all necessary information in one step, which could be cumbersome. For example, to see common components used in the wood industry, a user would need to select: 
    <ul>
      <li>Wood Industry</li>
      <li>One of the Processes</li>
      <li>A piece of Equipment</li>
    </ul>
    Only then would they see the common components in that particular piece of equipment. 
    <br><br>
    I decided to maintain this functionality for specific data but also implemented a more intuitive approach where all relevant processes, components, and equipment are displayed at every level. The displayed information dynamically narrows as the user selects more options, providing a much smoother user experience.
  </p>

  <h3>Tools Page Redesign</h3>
  <p>
    Before my work, the <strong>tools page</strong> displayed hyperlinks to various tools, which lacked organization and made navigation more difficult. I chose to group the pages based on content type and redesigned the page using modern <strong>cards</strong> and solutions, enhancing the aesthetic and usability of the user interface (UX). This made the tools more accessible and visually appealing for users.
  </p>

  <h3>Database Refactoring</h3>
  <p>
    On the backend, I helped <strong>refactor the SQL tables</strong> that powered the navigator. My work involved eliminating the need for multiple page tables, simplifying the relationships in the database without losing any critical data. I also took responsibility for formatting existing data and adding new data to be displayed in the webtool.
  </p>

  <h3>Training Material Creation</h3>
  <p>
    My work culminated in the creation of <strong>training material</strong> specific to EPRI. With permission from my project manager, I was able to take a subset of this training material and use it to showcase the work I accomplished during the project. This material helped to onboard and train others, ensuring they could understand and effectively use the new features I developed in the webtool.
  </p>

  <h3> CAD Icons </h3>
  <p>
      In addition to my software development, I used OnShape CAD services to create icons for new equipment in the PQI.
